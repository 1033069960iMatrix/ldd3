ldd3: Linux Device Drivers 3 examples updated to work in recent kernels

About
-----

This project aims to keep an up to date version of the original
Linux Device Drivers 3 (http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/) source code.

The original code can be found at: http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596005900/

Besides these examples, there is a plan to add more example drivers to show 
API/ABI not cover in LDD3, for example netlink and threaded interrupt handlers.
